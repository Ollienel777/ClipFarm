# ClipFarm

ClipFarm turns raw volleyball game footage into a filterable feed of highlight clips.
Upload a full-game VOD → the pipeline tracks the ball to find rallies → scores each
rally for "highlight-worthiness" (crowd reaction + rally shape) → cuts the survivors
into clips, tagged by action type and (eventually) player. The result is a per-player,
score-sortable clip library instead of a 30-minute video nobody rewatches.

This document is the entry point for both humans onboarding and AI agents contributing.
It should be enough to understand how the system fits together and where to make a change.

## Architecture & Flow

A game is uploaded **straight from the browser to R2** with a presigned URL, and a
Celery task processes it end to end. The heavy, occlusion-proof primary path is
**ball tracking**, not pose.

```
Browser (web/, Next.js)
    │  1. POST /games/uploads  ───►  FastAPI: validate type + size, presign
    │  2. PUT video ──────────────►  R2: raw/{game_id}.mp4   (api not involved)
    │  3. POST /games/{id}/uploads/complete
    ▼
FastAPI (api/)  ──►  HEAD the object, then enqueue process_game
    │
    ▼
Celery worker  ──  process_game_task()  (api/app/workers/tasks.py)
    │
    ├─ 0. Download video + extract audio energy envelope (reused by stages 2 & 4)
    │
    ├─ 1. BALL TRACKING → rally windows            (ml/pipeline/ball.py)
    │     ├─ track_ball()  ← Modal GPU (T4) if configured, else local CPU
    │     │                  R2-cached by video MD5 + model + sample rate
    │     ├─ find_contacts()      ← ballistic-residual contact detection
    │     └─ contacts_to_rallies()← group contacts into clip windows
    │
    ├─ 2. HIGHLIGHT SCORING → gate                 (ml/pipeline/score.py, audio.py)
    │     ├─ score_cheers()   ← post-rally crowd reaction (audio)
    │     ├─ score_highlights ← cheer + rally shape (+ optional CLIP)
    │     └─ drop rallies below highlight_score_threshold (0.50)
    │
    ├─ 3. POSE REFINEMENT (survivors only)         (ml/pipeline/detect.py)
    │     └─ classify_within_windows() ← YOLOv8-pose (Modal GPU) overrides action label if more confident
    │
    ├─ 4. Audio confidence weighting               (ml/pipeline/audio.py)
    │
    └─ 5. Cut clips → upload → persist             (ml/pipeline/clip.py, _sync_db.py)
          └─ FFmpeg per clip → R2: clips/, thumbs/ → Clip rows in Postgres
```

If `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` is unset or ball tracking fails entirely, the pipeline falls back
to a pose-first full-video scan (`ml/pipeline/detect.py::run_detection`) — the rare path.
It runs on Modal GPU too (`ml/modal_pose.py`), since scanning a whole video is the most
expensive thing the pipeline can do.

## The Processing Pipeline (detail)

The whole app is `process_game_task` in `api/app/workers/tasks.py`. Stages:

### 1. Ball tracking → rallies (`ml/pipeline/ball.py`)
The Roboflow RF-DETR ball model runs on sampled frames (~3/sec, fps-aware) to build a
trajectory. Because the raw tracker hops between the game ball, spare balls, and false
positives, the trajectory is **segmented** on implausible motion before anything is read
from it. Gravity is estimated per-video from the coherent segments, and a **contact** is
flagged where the ball's post-velocity deviates from the ballistic (free-flight)
prediction by more than a measured noise floor. Contacts are grouped into rally windows
by time gaps.

- All velocities are **px/second**, so thresholds hold at any source frame rate.
- Ball positions are cached to R2 keyed by `md5(video) + model + sample_rate`, so re-runs
  (re-uploads, pipeline tuning) load in seconds instead of re-tracking (~28–42 min on CPU).

### 2. Highlight scoring → gate (`ml/pipeline/score.py`, `audio.py`)
Each rally gets a `highlight_score` (0–1) from **cheer** (crowd/bench reaction in the
audio window after the last contact, normalized to the video's p99) plus **rally shape**
(contact count, duration, max ball speed, sharp direction changes, floor bounce). Rallies
below `highlight_score_threshold` (0.50) are dropped here — this is the precision gate, so
pose and clip-cutting only run on rallies worth keeping.

### 3. Pose refinement (`ml/pipeline/detect.py`)
YOLOv8-pose runs **only inside surviving rally windows** and overrides the
trajectory-derived action label when it is more confident.

### 4–5. Weighting + cutting (`ml/pipeline/clip.py`, `_sync_db.py`)
Audio adjusts label confidence, then FFmpeg cuts each clip + thumbnail, uploads to R2, and
writes `Clip` rows. Re-running a game clears its prior clips first (idempotent).

---

## Key Concepts (read these before changing detection)

- **Primary path is ball tracking, not pose.** Pose is a refinement + rare fallback. The
  ball model finds *where the action is*; pose only labels *what kind* within those windows.
- **Contacts are ballistic residuals, not angle/speed thresholds.** At coarse sampling,
  gravity alone bends the trajectory enough to fool a raw angle threshold. Detection
  measures deviation from predicted free-flight instead. See the tuned constants at the top
  of `ball.py`.
- **Cheer is the strongest highlight signal but it is court-blind.** A loud reaction to a
  *failure* (net serve on set point) or a *neighboring court* scores just as high. Ranking
  quality and multi-court false positives are known open problems (see backlog).
- **The ball cache is content-addressed.** Re-uploading the same file is nearly free.
  Changing the model or sample rate invalidates it automatically (it's in the key).
- **Model weights live on Modal, not here** (CF-164). The worker used to mount a
  `model_cache` volume so RF-DETR/YOLO weights survived a container recreate; now no
  weights are loaded in this image at all. Pose weights are baked into the
  `clipfarm-pose` image; the ball model still uses the `clipfarm-model-cache` Modal
  Volume, which is what that caching lesson (CF-40) applies to today.

## Local Development

Docker Compose is the standard path — it runs the whole stack (db, redis, api, worker, web).

```bash
# 1. Fill credentials
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker      # then edit: R2, Supabase, Roboflow, (optional) Modal

# 2. Bring it up
docker compose --env-file .env.docker up --build
#   web  → http://localhost:3000
#   api  → http://localhost:8000  (docs at /docs)

# 3. Enable the pre-commit hook (runs most of what CI runs; api/tests too,
#    once the dev install under "Tests" below is done)
git config core.hooksPath .hooks
```

Tests:

```bash
# Installs, once per worktree. The pip line supplies pytest for BOTH suites
# below — it is pinned in api/requirements-dev.txt and not in requirements.txt.
# Use Python 3.11: numpy 1.26.4 (pinned to match the image) has no wheel for
# 3.12+, so on a newer interpreter pip tries to build it and the whole install
# fails in compiler output. See the note at the top of requirements-dev.txt.
npm ci                                   # at the repo root
pip install -r api/requirements-dev.txt  # runtime deps + test-only deps

npm run test --workspace=web             # vitest, ~1s
npm run test:watch --workspace=web       # same suite, watch mode
python -m pytest ml/tests/               # ml eval metrics + dead-time
cd api && python -m pytest tests/        # api (CI and the hook run this too,
                                         # once requirements-dev is installed;
                                         # ~12s, the hook's slowest step —
                                         # CLIPFARM_SKIP_API_TESTS=1 opts out)
```

The api suite needs `requirements-dev.txt`, not just `requirements.txt`. Almost
every test guards its imports with `pytest.importorskip` (`sqlalchemy`,
`fastapi`, `celery`, `psycopg2`), so an incomplete install makes them **skip
silently** — the run still reports green while covering less than you think.
`requirements-dev.txt` pulls the runtime deps in via `-r requirements.txt` and
adds the test-only ones, so it is the only install you need. Test-only packages
deliberately stay out of `requirements.txt`, which builds the production image
via `Dockerfile.api`.

The CF-184 advisory-lock tests skip on a second condition: they assert what the
*database* does, so they need a real Postgres. They find one on localhost by
themselves — `docker compose up db` is enough — or take `LOCK_TEST_DATABASE_URL`,
which is what CI sets. Without either they skip, and the tests that actually
demonstrate the per-game lock do not run.

Notes:
- **Default `DATABASE_URL` is the local `db` container** (`.env.docker.example`
  Option A). The api migrates it on boot, so schema work stays on your machine.
- **Shared Supabase (Option B) is a deliberate opt-in.** Pointing at it is still
  the normal way to do general dev/testing — the team logs into the frontend with
  a shared dev account specifically so everyone uploads to and sees the same games
  and clips — but the api will **not** migrate it on boot. `scripts/auto_migrate.py`
  runs `alembic upgrade head` only when `DATABASE_URL` names a local host; against
  the pooler it skips and logs why (CF-189). Before that guard existed, any
  container boot — yours or a teammate's — could silently advance the shared
  schema, which is exactly what caused the 007→008 mismatch.
- **Landing a new migration on Supabase is a deliberate, one-time step**, not a
  side effect of `docker compose up`. When a PR with a new Alembic revision merges,
  one person runs `alembic upgrade head` against Supabase once (point `DATABASE_URL`
  at the pooler, run it, switch back). Don't rely on the next person's container
  boot to do it — it won't happen — coordinate it instead.
- `docker compose restart` does **not** reload env files. To pick up `.env.docker` changes:
  `docker compose up -d --force-recreate <service>`.
- The worker mounts `./api` and `./ml`, so Python changes are picked up on worker restart.
- Modal GPU is optional **for the dev stack only**, and the deployed image has no
  torch to fall back to (CF-164) — see `DEPLOY_RENDER.md`. Without `MODAL_TOKEN_*`
  in Docker Compose, ball tracking and pose have no local runtime and the pipeline
  degrades to trajectory-only labels; install `ml/requirements.txt` and run the
  worker outside Docker to exercise the local paths. With both Modal apps deployed
  (`modal deploy ml/modal_app.py && modal deploy ml/modal_pose.py`) + tokens set, it
  runs on a T4 in a few minutes.

## Configuration

All settings live in `api/app/config.py` (env-driven, prefixed to match). The most load-bearing:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `environment` | `development` | `production` makes the api and worker **refuse to start** when `database_url`, `cors_origins`, the `supabase_*` keys or the `r2_*` credentials are unset (plus `roboflow_api_key` and the `modal_token_*` pair on the worker, checked at worker boot since the api never calls either service), naming the ones that are (CF-172). Both production paths set it for you (`render.yaml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`); local dev leaves it alone and keeps its zero-config defaults. Not `debug` inverted — `debug` defaults to off, so gating on it would fire on every local run. |
| `highlight_score_threshold` | `0.50` | Rallies below this are dropped before pose/cutting. Env-overridable, no rebuild. |
| `clip_verify_enabled` | `false` | Use CLIP frames in scoring (slow on CPU; enable for GPU). |
| `pose_model` / `pose_imgsz` / `pose_skip_frames` | `yolov8s-pose.pt` / `1280` / `4` | Pose quality vs speed. Sent to the Modal GPU function; the defaults are what production runs since CF-164. |
| `database_url` | — | Supabase Postgres (async). |
| `lock_database_url` | `""` | Connection used *only* for the worker's per-game advisory lock (CF-184). Empty = use `database_url`, which is right for any direct or session-mode connection. Set it when `database_url` is a **transaction**-mode pooler (Supabase port 6543): that mode cannot hold a session-scoped lock, so the worker refuses to process rather than run unprotected. `lock_pooler_ports` (default `6543`) lists the ports refused for that reason — set it if your transaction pooler answers somewhere else. |
| `supabase_url` / `supabase_service_role_key` | — | Auth (JWKS) verification. |
| `r2_*` | — | Cloudflare R2 bucket + credentials. |
| `redis_url` / `celery_*` | redis:6379 | Job queue. |
| `modal_token_id` / `modal_token_secret` | "" | Enables the Modal GPU path for ball tracking *and* pose. |
| `allow_stub_detections` | `false` | Lets the pose-first fallback return **fabricated** clips when no pose runtime is available. Development only — the worker persists what it returns. Kept separate from `debug` on purpose, so a shared dev flag can't grant it. |
| `max_upload_bytes` | 8 GB | Upload size cap. Served to the web app by `GET /games/upload-config` so the advertised limit can't drift from the enforced one. |
| `single_put_max_bytes` / `upload_part_size_bytes` | 100 MiB / 100 MiB | Below the threshold an upload is one presigned PUT; above it, multipart with parts this size. |
| `upload_url_ttl_seconds` | `43200` (12 h) | Lifetime of a presigned upload URL — must cover a whole upload on a slow uplink. |
| `abandoned_upload_hours` | `24` | Upload tickets never completed are swept (row deleted, multipart aborted) on the owner's next presign. |
| `max_upload_duration_seconds` | `14400` (4 h) | Longest single video accepted. Checked at presign against the client-declared length, then again by the worker against the probed one. |
| `quota_window_hours` / `quota_max_games_per_window` / `quota_max_minutes_per_window` | `24` / `5` / `360` | Per-user rolling processing quota (cost guardrail — GPU inference is ~$0.25 per hour of footage). Both caps apply. Counted from the `upload_events` ledger, so deleting a game does not refund a slot. A duration the file size contradicts (missing, `0`, or physically impossible for the byte count) is priced from the size instead of trusted, and settled to the probed value by the worker. `GET /games/upload-config` returns the limits plus the caller's remaining allowance. |
| `raw_upload_retention_days` | `7` | Raw uploads are deleted this many days after upload (`0` = keep forever). Clips outlive the source; trimming a clip needs it, so this is also how long trims stay available. |

Secrets go in `.env.docker` (gitignored) for the stack, `api/.env` and `web/.env.local` for
local non-Docker runs. Never commit credentials.

### R2 bucket setup (required for uploads to work)

The browser PUTs video directly to R2, so the bucket must allow it — without these
two settings uploads fail in the browser with an opaque CORS error, no matter how
the api is configured.

**CORS policy** — `ExposeHeaders: ETag` is not optional: multipart completion sends
each part's ETag back to the api, and a cross-origin response header is unreadable
to JavaScript unless it is exposed.

```json
[{
  "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-web-domain", "http://localhost:3000"],
  "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET", "HEAD"],
  "AllowedHeaders": ["content-type"],
  "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
  "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
}]
```

**Lifecycle rule** — abort incomplete multipart uploads after ~7 days. The api aborts
on delete and on the abandoned-upload sweep; this is the backstop for uploads neither
path reaches. Parts of an unfinished upload are billed until aborted and are invisible
to a normal object listing.

---

## Data Model

Postgres via SQLAlchemy (`api/app/models/`), RLS enabled on all tables.

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| `User` | Supabase-authenticated user (owner of teams/games). |
| `Team` / `Player` | Roster. `Player.team_id` links to a team. (Teams CRUD UI is a backlog item.) |
| `Game` | An uploaded VOD + processing status (`processing` → `ready`/`failed`). |
| `Clip` | A cut highlight: time window, `action_type`, `confidence`, `highlight_score`, R2 URLs, `player_id`. |
| `Collection` | User-curated groupings of clips. |
| `Correction` | User relabel events (written on relabel; readable via `GET /corrections` + CSV `/corrections/export` — training signal). |
| `DeadTimeRun` / `DeadTimeClip` | Separate experimental dead-time detection flow. |
| `UploadEvent` | Append-only quota ledger (CF-91). One row per accepted upload, holding the seconds charged against the per-user window. Deliberately not derived from `Game`: games are hard-deleted, so counting them let a user refund a slot whose GPU cost was already spent. `game_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`. |

## Conventions & Workflow

We work like a small company: **branches + PRs only, never commit to `main`.**

- **Branch naming**: `category/CF-##-short-description` (lowercase-kebab category).
  Categories in use: `devops`, `ball-detection`, `docs`. `CF-##` is the board card ID.
- **PRs**: use the template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`). One card ≈ one PR. Link
  `CF-##`. Squash on merge.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every PR and is **required to pass** before
  merge (branch protection on `main`): `Web (lint + typecheck)` and `API (ruff + mypy)`.
  The `.hooks/pre-commit` hook runs the exact same checks locally (ruff, mypy, eslint, tsc).
- **Backlog** lives on the `ClipFarmVB` GitHub Project (#1) as `CF-##` cards, each
  backed by an issue titled `CF-## · Description`. Link one from a PR with a bare
  `Closes #<issue>` — `**Board:** CF-##` alone is not parsed by GitHub, so the
  issue stays open and the card never moves.
- **Agent conventions** live in `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root.

---

## Infrastructure & External Services

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| **Supabase** | Postgres (data) + Auth (JWKS JWT). Free tier **auto-pauses after ~7 days idle** (kept alive by the keepalive workflow — see gotchas). |
| **Cloudflare R2** | Object storage; zero egress cost (important — this is a video app). `ball-cache/` holds cached trajectories. |
| **Roboflow `inference`** | Local RF-DETR ball model `volleyball-ball-tracking-0eo7r/3`. Pinned to `inference==1.3.3`. |
| **Modal** | Serverless T4 GPU for ball tracking. App `clipfarm-ball-tracking`; deploy `modal deploy ml/modal_app.py`. |
| **Redis** | Celery broker + result backend. |
| **Render** | Production hosting for web + api + worker + the Key Value broker, defined as code in `render.yaml`. |

**Deploying:** production is Render — see **[`DEPLOY_RENDER.md`](./DEPLOY_RENDER.md)**
(CF-68) for the Blueprint setup, secrets, domains and the deploy procedure.
[`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md) (CF-41) is a separate, optional runbook for self-hosting
the backend on a VPS — an alternative, not the production path.

---

## Known Limitations / Gotchas

- **Supabase free-tier auto-pause**: after ~7 days idle the pooler returns "tenant not
  found" and all processing fails. Unpausing takes ~2 min to propagate. Mitigated by the
  `Supabase keepalive` workflow (`.github/workflows/keepalive.yml`, CF-18), which runs
  `SELECT 1` every 2 days to keep the project active — it needs the `SUPABASE_DB_URL`
  repo secret and only fires from `main`. Note the keepalive only *prevents* a pause; it
  can't *cure* one — if the project is already paused the run just fails red, so unpause
  it manually (Supabase dashboard) and the next scheduled run goes green. The permanent
  fix is upgrading to Supabase Pro (no auto-pause; see CF-68).
- **Multi-court false positives**: footage with several simultaneous games produces junk
  clips from neighboring courts (ball *and* audio). Court-ROI filtering is the top open
  detection task.
- **Scoring ranks poorly even though the gate works**: cheer can't distinguish a great
  rally from a loud non-rally (set-win celebration, funny error). The 0.50 gate is solid;
  ordering within survivors is not. A learned ranker (from user feedback) is the plan.
- **Jersey OCR (`ocr.py`) is not wired in** — every clip's `player_id` is currently null.
- **`inference` must stay pinned** (`==1.3.3`): an unpinned resolver backtracks to a
  version predating RF-DETR support and the ball model silently fails to load.
- **Celery worker runs `--pool=solo`**: one job at a time; a hung transfer blocks the queue
  (mitigated by boto3 socket timeouts). Not horizontally scaled yet.

---

## Where to Look First

- **Understand the app** → this file, then `api/app/workers/tasks.py` (`process_game_task`).
- **Change detection** → `ml/pipeline/ball.py` (constants at top are heavily tuned — read
  the comments before touching).
- **Change scoring** → `ml/pipeline/score.py` + `ml/pipeline/audio.py`.
- **Add an API endpoint** → `api/app/routers/` + wire in `api/app/main.py`.
- **Change the frontend** → `web/` (⚠ read `web/AGENTS.md` first).
- **Every configurable knob** → `api/app/config.py`.
