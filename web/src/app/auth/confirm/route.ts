 * A `token_hash` carries everything verification needs, so any browser works —
 * and the session is established here rather than by whatever the link happened
 * to land on.
 *
 * Inert until the Supabase "Confirm signup" template emits a link at this

 * would verify, sign the user in and drop them on `/games` with the password
 * they forgot still set, and the link is single-use, so nothing tells them it
 * went wrong. Unwired types fail closed as `link_invalid` instead.
