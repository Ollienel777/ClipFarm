/**
 * Starting a cross-origin download without navigating the app away (CF-100).
 *
 * `<a download>` is ignored for cross-origin URLs — R2 is a different origin —
 * so the file is named by the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header the api
 * asks R2 to send, and the browser has to be pointed at the URL for that header
 * to arrive.
 *
 * The obvious way to point it, `window.location.href = url`, is the wrong one.
 * A response that carries `attachment` never commits a navigation, so it looks
 * like nothing happened and the page stays put — but a response that *doesn't*
 * is rendered in place: an expired signature, a clock skew, an R2 5xx, and the
 * user is looking at R2's XML error document where the app used to be, with
 * their unsaved label edits gone. The failure mode we can't rule out is exactly
 * the one that costs the most.
 *
 * A hidden iframe takes the same navigation off the top-level browsing context.
 * `attachment` downloads exactly as before; anything else renders into a
 * sandboxed element nobody can see, and the app is untouched. The cost is that
 * an R2-side failure is silent rather than loud — the caller still reports a
 * failure of the api call that mints the URL, which is the failure that is
 * actually likely here, but a signature R2 rejects will look like a click that
 * did nothing. That is a worse-to-debug outcome traded for a much less costly
 * one.
 *
 * **Why not a new tab.** `window.open` — opened synchronously on the click so
 * the activation survives the presign `await`, then pointed at the URL — needs
 * none of the state below, and turns the silent failure above into a visible
 * one, which is a real advantage this module does not have an answer to. It
 * was not chosen for the workflow rather than the mechanism: the control this
 * serves sits on every card in a grid, and the batch download it exists for
 * (the CF-101 case) means a run of clicks. Each one flashes a tab, and on iOS
 * Safari each one *switches away from the app* — an attachment closes it again
 * immediately, but the user has still been taken out of the grid they were
 * working down. The failure path costs a tab that has to be closed by hand
 * when the presign fails, and `window.open` returns null under a strict popup
 * blocker, so the handler needs this path as a fallback anyway.
 *
 * That is a judgement about which cost is worse, not a proof. If the team
 * would rather have loud failures than an undisturbed grid, the swap is small
 * and this module is the only thing that changes.
 *
 * Everything below is about one consequence of the trade: **a frame removed
 * while its transfer is still running kills the download and reports nothing.**
 * Firefox and Safari tie the request to the frame's lifetime, which is why the
 * frame cannot be removed synchronously — and that fact does not stop being
 * true later, which is what the first two attempts at reclaiming frames each
 * got wrong in turn.

 * answering is not what the frame is needed for, so the timer was an abort of
 * whatever was still streaming. A 40MB clip over ~3 Mbps needs about 107
 * seconds. No constant fixes that: a slow enough connection beats any of them.
 *
 * Count-based reclamation replaced it, which was better and still not right —
 * see MIN_FRAME_AGE_MS. An empty sandboxed `display:none` frame costs
 * essentially nothing, so this is set where a batch-download session never

/**
 * How old a frame must be before it may be reclaimed at all.
 *
 * This is the half the count alone got wrong. Eviction is FIFO, so the frame
 * it takes is the one that started earliest — and a frame is only still
 * interesting *because* its transfer has not finished, which makes the oldest
 * entry disproportionately the slow one. The policy preferentially reaped
 * exactly what it existed to protect: start a 40MB clip on mobile, then save
 * eight short ones over the next minute — an ordinary batch session, and the
 * reason CF-101 exists — and the ninth append killed the 40MB transfer.
 *
 * So age gates eviction and count only triggers it. Ten minutes is far past
 * any plausible transfer of a clip, and unlike the original timer nothing is
 * ever removed *on* a schedule: a frame is reclaimed only when later downloads
 * need the room, and only if it is old enough to be almost certainly finished.
 * When every frame is too young the pool simply grows past the limit, which is
 * the right way to be wrong — some empty elements, rather than a coach's
 * download dying silently.

  // An earlier version of this comment worried that an engine ignoring the

  // token is dropped while the sandbox still applies. That inverts the
  // history: blocking downloads in sandboxed frames and `allow-downloads` are
  // the same change — Chrome shipped both in 83 — so the token is unrecognised
  // only where there is no block to opt out of. Old engine, no sandbox
  // download restriction; new engine, restriction plus the opt-out we set.
