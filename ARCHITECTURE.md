# ClipFarm — Architecture & Design Decisions

A reference for the system's structure and the reasoning behind its key choices.
Written to double as interview prep: each decision lists the trade-off that drove it.

## What it does

Users upload full volleyball game recordings. The system automatically finds rallies,
classifies actions (spike/serve/dig/set/block), scores highlight-worthiness, cuts
per-rally clips, and — opt-in — produces one condensed video with the dead time
between rallies removed.

Cloudflare R2 (S3 API): raw videos, clips, thumbs, condensed videos, ball cache
```

- **Monorepo**: `api/` (FastAPI + Celery), `ml/` (pure pipeline code), `web/` (Next.js
  app-router).
- **Docker Compose dev stack**: `db` (unused local PG), `redis`, `api`, `worker`
  (same image as api), `web`. Code is volume-mounted so containers hot-reload without
  rebuilds; only dependency changes need `--build`.

## The processing pipeline (`process_game_task`)

One Celery task, imperative stages, each stage wrapped in try/except so a failing
enhancement degrades instead of killing the run:

| Stage | What | Why it's ordered here |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Audio RMS envelope (ffmpeg → numpy) | Computed once (~seconds), reused by stages 2 and 4 |
| 1 | Ball tracking (Roboflow model) → contacts → rally windows | Primary signal: physics-based, occlusion-tolerant, no GPU |
| 2 | Highlight scoring (cheer + rally shape [+ CLIP]) → drop low scorers | Precision gate *before* expensive pose so pose only runs on keepers |
| 3 | YOLOv8-pose inside surviving windows → refine action labels | Pose is the most expensive signal; scope it to windows |
| 4 | Audio confidence weighting | Cheap adjustment, no filtering |
| 5 | Cut clips (ffmpeg), upload to R2, persist rows | |
| 6 | *(opt-in)* Condensed dead-time-removed video | See below; uses the **pre-gate** stage-1 signal |

Fallback chain: no `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` (or ball failure) → pose detection on Modal GPU →
local CPU pose. Each level catches and falls through.

### Key ML design decisions

- **Ball trajectory over pose as the primary signal.** A contact is a deviation from
  ballistic flight: gravity is estimated per-video (median vertical acceleration of
  coherent track segments), then residuals above a speed-scaled floor mark hits.
  Rationale: the ball is almost always visible, players occlude each other; physics
  generalizes across camera angles where pose heuristics don't.
- **All velocity thresholds are px/second, not px/frame** (CF-34). Same footage at
  60 fps halves px/frame velocities and silently breaks px/frame thresholds; per-second
  units make tuning portable across sources. Sampling is fps-aware too
  (`sample_every = round(fps / 3)` → ~3 detections/sec at any frame rate).
- **Content-addressed ball cache on R2.** Tracking a 22-min video costs ~30 min on CPU
  but depends only on (video bytes, model version, sample rate) — so positions are
  cached at `ball-cache/{md5(video)}-{model}-s{rate}.json`. Re-uploads and pipeline
  re-tuning hit the cache in seconds. Classic memoization keyed by content hash, not id.
- **Precision gate before expensive compute** (stage 2 before stage 3): scoring is
  cheap (audio + features already in hand), pose is not. The gate turns a 22-min VOD
  into ~5 min of clip candidates before the expensive model runs.

## Dead-time removal (condense stage)

**Requirement:** "cut out the waiting between rallies" → one condensed video.

- **Detection is free.** The gaps between stage-1 rally windows *are* the dead time,
  so no extra ML or decode pass runs. `ml/pipeline/dead_time.py` regroups the raw ball
  contacts with *coverage* semantics rather than reusing `contacts_to_rallies()`
  (which curates highlights): no 30s clip cap (a long rally stays one span), looser
  2-contact minimum, pad → clamp → merge. Pure functions, unit-tested, tunables as
  kwargs (ml/ never imports app config).
- **Pre-gate signal, deliberately.** The condensed video must keep *every* rally,
  not just the ones the highlight gate scored well — so it consumes the stage-1
  output snapshot, not the post-gate survivors.
- **Stitching: per-window re-encode + concat demuxer with `-c copy`.**
  Alternative considered: single `filter_complex` trim/concat graph. Rejected because
  it decodes the discarded footage too, builds a huge filtergraph for many windows,
  and fails atomically. Two-step encodes only kept footage, isolates per-window
  failures (log + skip), and the final stitch is stream-copy (near-free).
  A/V-sync gotchas handled: identical codec params across parts, pinned audio rate
  (`ar=48000` — mixed rates glitch at copy-concat joins), `avoid_negative_ts` per part,
  `+genpts` on the stitch.
- **Opt-in per upload** (checkbox → `condense` form field → task kwarg + `games`
  column). Encoding kept footage is roughly realtime on CPU and the worker pool is
  solo, so the cost is only paid when asked for.
- **Non-fatal by construction:** clips are saved before the condense stage; any
  condense failure logs and the game still goes `ready`. A nice-to-have must never
  hold the core deliverable hostage.
- **Deterministic R2 key** (`condensed/{game_id}.mp4`): task retries overwrite
  instead of orphaning objects — cheap idempotency.

History: this replaced a half-built standalone "dead time" flow (own tables/router/
task/pages, and inverted semantics — it produced clips *of* the dead time). Migration
008 drops those tables; detection now rides the existing pipeline signal instead of a
separate motion pass.

## API & data decisions

- **Async FastAPI, sync Celery, two DB engines.** Request handlers use
  SQLAlchemy async + asyncpg. Celery workers have no event loop, so `_sync_db.py`
  builds a parallel sync engine (`+asyncpg` stripped from the URL). Interview point:
  async frameworks don't reach into background workers; pick per-context.
- **Status is a coarse enum** (`queued → processing → ready | failed`) polled by the
  frontend every 4-10s. No WebSockets/SSE — polling is trivially correct, stateless,
  and fine at this scale; push channels are a scale optimization, not a starting point.
- **Object storage URLs are stored public-form, served presigned.** DB rows hold
  `{r2_public_url}/{key}`; routers convert to time-limited presigned URLs on read.
  Storage stays private; links expire; the DB never holds secrets.
- **Uploads stream through the API with a hard cap.** `LimitedReader` wraps the
  request stream and raises past N bytes — enforces the limit even when
  Content-Length is absent. XHR (not fetch) on the frontend for upload progress.
- **Auth:** Supabase issues JWTs; the API verifies them (JWKS), never handles
  passwords. Next.js middleware guards routes server-side.
- **Migrations:** Alembic, applied automatically by the api container's start command
  (`alembic upgrade head && uvicorn`). Destructive drops use `IF EXISTS` because dev
  databases drift (008 hit a missing index that 005 claimed to create).

## Operational decisions

- **CPU-only torch in Docker** (`--index-url .../whl/cpu`): several GB smaller than
  the CUDA build; GPU work is delegated to Modal instead of shipped in the image.
- **Pinned `inference==1.3.3`** (CF-33): unpinned, pip's resolver backtracked to an
  ancient version that predates the ball model's architecture and broke it at runtime.
  Lesson: resolver backtracking can "succeed" into a broken state; pin what matters.
- **arm64 build fix:** `zxing-cpp` has no arm64 wheel, so Apple Silicon builds compile
  it from source — `build-essential`/`cmake` are installed and purged *inside the same
  Docker layer* so the final image stays lean (same-layer delete = zero size cost).
- **boto3 socket timeouts** (CF-32): with a solo worker pool, one hung S3 transfer
  blocks the entire queue; connect/read timeouts + retries turn hangs into retryable
  failures.
- **Known trade-off:** the solo Celery pool serializes jobs — one long condense/track
  blocks the queue. Accepted for dev; the scale-out path is more workers or a
  dedicated queue, not threads (the work is CPU/ffmpeg-bound).

## Testing strategy

- **Pure logic gets unit tests** (`ml/tests/test_dead_time.py`): interval math,
  grouping, padding/clamping — fast, no video, no models.
- **ffmpeg/cv2 behavior gets harness scripts**: run against real or synthetic
  footage locally in a personal scratch dir (git-ignored `ball-track/`);
  assertions on durations/streams, human eyeballs on output. Model behavior
  isn't unit-testable; cached tracking fixtures keep iterations fast and free.
- **End-to-end**: docker compose stack + real upload through the UI.
