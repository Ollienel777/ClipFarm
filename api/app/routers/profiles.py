#
# What it does NOT buy, despite the obvious reading: protection for a released
# handle. It rate-limits the *renamer*, so when @coach_dan becomes @dan_coach the
# old name is free immediately and anyone can PATCH it onto their own account
# with their own cooldown untouched — the former holder is the only party
# delayed. Defending that needs a tombstone holding a released handle against its
# previous owner for a window, which is not implemented.

    The R2 bucket is not public — every other media URL in the app is presigned

    the stored `r2_public_url` form here would hand the client a URL it cannot
    load, and the API would still report success.

    Presigned URLs also carry a fresh signature each time, so a re-uploaded
    avatar is picked up without a cache-busting query param — which is just as
    well, since a `?v=` baked into the stored value breaks the key extraction in
    `presign_from_stored_url`.

    The cost of that freshness is that the URL never repeats, so an unchanged
    avatar is re-fetched on every page load and sidebar mount. Negligible at one
    avatar per page; not negligible once CF-109 renders a feed of them. The fix
    then is a stable URL plus a version token taken from the object itself (an
    ETag, or an `avatar_updated_at` column) — that buys freshness *and* caching.
    Worth doing before the feed multiplies the request count, not now.
