"""
Postgres advisory-lock per-game processing lock (CF-184).

`process_game_task` must never run twice for the same game at once — Celery +
Redis is at-least-once (a task outliving the broker visibility timeout, or a
worker being killed, causes redelivery), and once there is more than one worker
that redelivery can land on a *second* worker while the first is still running.
This lock makes concurrent double-processing impossible; the idempotent clip
refresh (CF-37) separately handles sequential re-runs.

**Why Postgres and not Redis.** The original lock was `SET NX EX` with a TTL
deliberately longer than the broker visibility timeout — correct against a
*slow* task, but a TTL has no relationship to whether the holder is still alive.
A hard-killed worker (every Render deploy does this) left its lock behind for
the full TTL, so the requeued copy found it held, no-opped, and the game sat in
`processing` for ~3h with nothing working on it. That stranding is what #149's
reaper existed to clean up after.

A **session-scoped** advisory lock is held by a database *connection*, and the
server drops it the moment that connection dies. Kill the worker, the connection
closes, the lock goes with it, and the redelivered task acquires it and runs.
The failure mode stops existing instead of being reaped after the fact — so
there is no TTL here, and nothing to tune against `celery_visibility_timeout`.

**How fast "dies" is, honestly.** A kill that closes the socket — SIGKILL, a
container stop, a crash — sends a FIN and the lock is released within
milliseconds. A kill that *severs* the connection without one (host loss, a
network partition, a namespace torn down before the FIN flushes) leaves the
backend blocked on a read from a peer that will never answer, and only the
server's TCP keepalives reap it. That tail is bounded by
`tcp_keepalives_idle` **on the server**, which is why `_get_engine()` asks for a
short one (see there for what happens through a pooler). Worst case is minutes
to tens of minutes rather than the old lock's flat 3h on *every* hard kill — but
it is not zero, and this is the one place the guarantee is softer than
"released immediately".

Two things this depends on, both handled below:

- **The lock connection is dedicated and lives for the whole task.** It is not a
  pooled session that may be recycled mid-task — a connection returned to a pool
  and handed to someone else would take the lock with it. Hence `NullPool` and a
  connection held open by the `GameLock` instance itself.
- **The connection must be session-mode.** Supabase's *transaction*-mode pooler
  (port 6543) can serve consecutive statements from different backends, which
  silently breaks session-scoped locks: `pg_try_advisory_lock` returns true and
  the lock is on some other backend, or already gone. That is worse than the bug
  this replaces, so the port is refused outright and `acquire()` additionally
  verifies the lock is really held on its own backend. Point `LOCK_DATABASE_URL`
  at the session-mode port (5432) when `DATABASE_URL` is a transaction pooler.
- **The connection can die without the worker dying** — a failover, an
  `idle_session_timeout`, a `pg_terminate_backend` — and the lock goes with it
  while the job carries on. `still_held()` is the check for that, called at the
  long stage boundaries in tasks.py so a redelivery can never end up running
  beside a job that never noticed it had lost exclusivity.

NOTE for CF-65b (prefork): the engine is built lazily, per process, on first
acquire — a forked child never inherits a parent's connection. Keep it that way
(and keep tasks.py's import of this module inside the task body).
