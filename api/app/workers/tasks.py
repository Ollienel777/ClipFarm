    future bump on either side cannot bring the *request* back. The response is

    `classify_action` returns float literals and `x()`/`y()` cast with `float()`,

    a test (there is no seam into `process_game_task` — see
    test_worker_safety.py).

    Delete raw uploads older than `raw_upload_retention_days` (CF-194).

    Two passes, and the second is what makes this safe to run repeatedly:

    1. **Rows.** Every game past the cutoff has its `raw_video_url` cleared —
       guarded on the URL the sweep saw, so a row that changed underneath is
       left alone. Nothing is deleted from storage in this pass.
    2. **Objects.** Every object under `raw/` older than the cutoff that no game
       row still references is deleted, in batches. That covers the keys pass 1
       just released *and* any object orphaned by an earlier failed delete or a
       worker killed between the two passes, so the sweep converges instead of
       leaking: null-first ordering can only ever cost storage, and this is what
       reclaims it. Two independent guards protect a live upload — it is
       referenced by its row (`uploading` rows included, from the moment the
       ticket is issued), and it is newer than the cutoff.

    Order matters between the passes. Deleting first and clearing second can
    leave a row pointing at a missing object, which turns every later trim into
    a download failure plus two Celery retries — a broken feature rather than a
    storage cost.

    Purging a raw video is not free: `recut_clip` re-cuts from it, so trimming a
    clip stops working once its game's source expires. That is the deliberate
    trade (the retention window is how long trims stay available) — the API
    reports it via ClipOut.source_available so the UI can say so.

    **Where this runs.** At the end of a successful process_game run: no cron or
    celery-beat exists in this stack, and the worker is the one place already
    off the request path. `_sweep_abandoned_uploads` (CF-163) makes the other
    choice — the owner's next presign — but that is per-user and only reaches
    people who are still uploading. Retention is a global cost, so it wants a
    global trigger. Both share the same limitation: enforcement stops while the
    system is idle, which is also when the bill stops growing. A beat schedule
    is the real fix and is a follow-up, not this card.

    Reporting must never break processing: every failure is logged and
    swallowed, and a partial sweep resumes on the next run.
