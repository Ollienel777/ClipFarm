# games.error_message is a bounded column and nothing on the write path enforced
# that. The value is `str(exc)` from an arbitrary failure — a Modal error
# carrying a remote traceback runs long. Overflowing raised DataError from
# *inside* the task's own `except` handler, which cost the `failed` write and
# the retry decision (the `finally` still ran, so the lock was released), so the
# row sat in `processing` forever: the CF-184 stranded-game symptom, reached by
# the code that exists to explain a failure. Clamped here rather than at each
# call site so every writer is covered, including the next one.
#
# The width is read off the model, not repeated: it is the column that imposes
# this, so a column that changes must not need a matching edit here to stay
# correct. Unbounded means no clamp at all — which is how CF-226 lands. That
# card widens the column to Text (as CF-217 did for games.upload_id, the same
# class of overflow), and this file should not appear in its diff.
#
# Until then this is a mitigation, not a fix: the value that overflows is a
# Modal remote traceback, i.e. the operator-actionable half of the failure, so
# the clamp truncates the diagnostic someone opened the row to read.
# getattr, not a plain attribute: an unbounded column type need not carry a
# `length` at all, and that case is exactly the one this must survive.
