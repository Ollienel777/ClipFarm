"""Centralized read authorization (CF-108).

Every router used to assert `owner_id == user_id` for itself. That was correct
while owners were the only readers, but it puts the rule in six places — and the
moment one of them is allowed to return someone else's content, the others are
the leak surface. This module is the single place that answers "may this viewer
read this?", for both single-object fetches and list queries.

Four entry points, deliberately kept in step:

* ``can_view_game`` / ``can_view_clip`` — for an object already loaded.
* ``can_identify`` — may a caller attach the game's title and its players'
  names. Not the same question as reading the clip; see the asymmetry below.
  Unlike the others this one is a single endpoint's gate rather than a rule the
  system keeps — its docstring says which, and CF-283 (#330) settles it.
* ``visible_games_filter`` — a predicate for a game list. The rule is over
  ``Game`` alone, so it needs no join and there is nothing to get wrong.
* ``apply_clip_visibility`` — takes the whole statement and returns it joined
  and filtered. A predicate would not be safe here: the clip rule reads
  ``games.visibility``, and a caller who forgets the join gets a cartesian
  product that fails *open* with no warning from SQLAlchemy.

Both list forms filter **in SQL**. Post-filtering a page in Python silently
breaks pagination (ask for 50, get 11) and reads rows the viewer may not see.

Writes are NOT covered here. Creating, editing and deleting stay owner-only, and
the routers keep their own ownership checks for those paths.

**Unauthenticated surface.** Allowing anonymous reads means ``GET /games/{id}``,
``GET /games/{id}/clips``, ``GET /clips/{id}/share`` and
``GET /clips/{id}/download`` now reach the database without a credential,
joining ``GET /users/{handle}`` from CF-107 — five unthrottled endpoints where
there were none. The download one is the most expensive: it mints an attachment
URL for the full clip, so an unthrottled caller can pull the bytes rather than
just a row. Nothing can be public yet, so all of that traffic 404s today, making
this a load question rather than a disclosure one.

**That last sentence expires with CF-109.** The safety here is not the 404
choice, it is that no row can be set `public` — so the moment CF-109 lands the
visibility setter, an unauthenticated caller can walk ``/clips/{id}/download``
and pull full clip bytes, unthrottled, with an egress bill attached. That makes
rate limiting (CF-186, #189) a blocker on CF-109 rather than a parallel task,
and this endpoint is what changed the severity of that ordering. The dependency
is recorded on CF-109 (#139) too — a paragraph in a module nobody has to open
is not an ordering constraint. The 404-not-403 choice below keeps none of them
an existence oracle in the meantime.

**One deliberate asymmetry.** A public clip inside a private game is reachable
by direct link (``GET /clips/{id}/share``) and through a collection, but
``GET /games/{id}/clips`` 404s the whole endpoint because the game itself isn't
viewable. That is intended: an override publishes *that clip*, not the right to
enumerate its game's contents. `test_public_clip_in_private_game_*` pins all
three paths so the split stays a decision rather than an accident.

    **Scope: this is one endpoint's gate, not a module-wide invariant.** Unlike
    its neighbours it does not describe how the system behaves — `collections.py`
    hands `player_name` to every clip surviving `apply_clip_visibility`, which
    gates on the *clip*, so for a public clip in a private game one signed-in
    viewer gets two answers:

        GET /clips/{id}/download        -> withholds the player's name
        GET /collections/{id}/clips     -> returns it

    CF-283 (#330) picks one. Read what follows as the argument for the answer
    this side took, not as the rule in force.

    The argument: identification is a different question from readability, and
    it differs in exactly the asymmetric case above. A public clip inside a
    private game is readable by direct link, but the game's title and the
    tagged player's real name are not — /share discloses neither and list_clips
    is gated on the game — so naming the file after them would hand both to a
    caller who could not otherwise reach either, on footage of named young
    people. That argues for the game's own predicate, which is what this
    returns.

    It is named rather than inlined because the question recurs: CF-100's
    download filename asks it (the name rides in the presigned URL in
    cleartext), CF-101's zip entries will ask it again, and a rule living
    inline in one router is one the second caller re-derives — differently.
