    RFC 5987's `filename*=UTF-8''…` — every current browser prefers `filename*`
    when both are present, and the ASCII one is what an old client falls back
    to. Emitting only the escaped form would name the file for nobody; emitting
    only the ASCII form is what dropped non-Latin titles on the floor.

    The filtering here is a header concern, not a filename one — services/
    filenames.py has already removed what is illegal *on disk*. What is left to
    close is the quoted string itself: a surviving `"` ends it and lets the rest
    of the value be read as further parameters, and a CR or LF would split the
    header outright. `filename*` is percent-encoded, so it cannot carry either,
    but it is filtered on the same pass rather than trusted to the encoder.

    The ASCII form falls back to "download" when no ASCII survives, keeping the
    extension: `filename=""` names the file after the URL's last path segment,
    which is the UUID this whole scheme exists to replace.

    **The fallback degrades and is meant to.** Where a name's only distinguishing
    text is non-ASCII, what is left is the scheme's fixed parts: two Cyrillic-
    titled games both fall back to `(condensed).mp4`, and nothing here can tell
    them apart short of transliterating, which would invent a spelling nobody
    chose. The clip scheme survives this because the timestamp is ASCII. It is

    shipping browser for over a decade — this parameter is for clients that are
    already reading a header from 2011.
