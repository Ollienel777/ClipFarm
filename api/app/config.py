# survives boot and fails at the first upload or auth check instead.

    # on test1 and more on the other three (2s->12s, 83s->100s, 0s->20s), and on
    # the fifth it abstains rather than cut 118s of rally.
    #
    # Net at the harness' 4:1 live-cut exchange rate: +533s vs +134s over the
    # three fixtures comparable across games. Counting all five gives +1440s vs
    # +633s, and that larger figure is the misleading one: test1 and test3 supply
    # most of the gap and their own fixture notes exclude them from cross-game
    # comparison. Three of the five were held out while it was tuned.
    #
    # Worth reading past the net: across those three comparable fixtures "rules"
    # cuts 85s of live play and "guarded" cuts 132s, so the default cuts 47s more
    # of the thing this repo protects and buys it back with dead time at 4:1.
    # That trade was taken deliberately — the dead-time win is large and holds on
    # every fixture it condenses, and 4:1 is the rate this repo's own harness
    # scores against — but it was a judgement, not something the numbers decided.
    # Weigh live play more heavily and CONDENSE_MODE=rules is the reasonable

    # Worker redelivery safety (CF-65a). Redis' default visibility timeout is
    # 3600s: a task still running past it is redelivered while it runs. Before
    # CF-184 that was the CF-45 duplicate-processing root cause, and the fix was
    # "size above worst-case task time" — back then the local-CPU fallback ran at
    # ~1.3–2x realtime, so a long match with Modal down could run for hours.
    #
    # CF-192 asked whether the CF-167 cap raise (2 GB → 8 GB, longer videos) means
    # this must rise to match. It does not, and the most direct reason is that the
    # premise no longer holds where it is deployed: since CF-164 every model runs
    # on Modal and the worker image ships no torch/ultralytics/inference
    # (Dockerfile.api) — "local-CPU ball tracking is gone", restorable only by
    # installing ml/requirements.txt outside the image for dev. So in production
    # the worst-case task time is the Modal path (single-digit-minute tracking),
    # nowhere near 2h; a job that outruns this timeout is a dev-stack event, not a
    # production one. The card's 2.6–4h CPU figure is absent in the image, not
    # merely rare.
    #
    # Two further facts, for when that dev-stack redelivery does happen:
    #   • Correctness does not depend on the timeout. CF-184's session-scoped
    #     advisory lock (app/workers/locks.py) — not this number — is what makes
    #     concurrent double-processing impossible: a redelivery finds the lock
    #     held by the still-running original and no-ops.
    #   • That no-op is not free, and neither is a re-run — so redelivery is a
    #     defect, not a harmless event (an earlier draft called it harmless). The
    #     duplicate returns; acks_late acks it, so the original's delivery is now
    #     spent, and a hard kill after that strands the game in `processing` with
    #     nothing to requeue it (the #149 reaper was retired as superseded by the
    #     lock, which preserves mutual exclusion, not at-least-once). And when the
    #     duplicate instead finds the lock free (original finished), it RE-RUNS:
    #     CF-37's refresh hard-deletes the clips and re-creates them with fresh
    #     uuids, and collection_clips.clip_id / corrections.clip_id are ON DELETE
    #     CASCADE — so a re-run silently drops curated collections and user
    #     corrections. Cheap in compute (ball positions cached, CF-11), not data.
    #
    # Why not raise it anyway, to be safe? Raising above worst-case WOULD close
    # the spent-delivery hole — no redelivery means no no-op to consume the
    # original's delivery, which is exactly what "size above worst-case" bought
    # under CF-45. But it buys that at proportionally longer recovery latency (the
    # too-high cost below), leaves the destructive re-run untouched (that fires on
    # any legitimate kill-and-requeue too), and is unnecessary given the image has
    # no multi-hour path. The two defects' real fixes live elsewhere:
    # self.retry(countdown=...) in the duplicate branch for the delivery hole, and
    # decoupling clip ids from re-runs for the cascade. So 2h stays:
    #   • too high → on the Redis transport a hard-killed worker's task is only
    #     restored to the queue after this timeout elapses (there is no push
    #     cancel). It is a floor, not a ceiling: under --pool=solo
    #     `restore_visible` runs only while the worker polls the broker, so a
    #     worker busy on another game defers the restore — the real wait is 2h
    #     plus whatever else it processes first. This is the live reason to keep
    #     it low.
    #   • too low → the dev-stack redelivery above; harmless to correctness,
    #     costly to a dev's data, and not a production concern.
