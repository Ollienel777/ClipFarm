"""Sentry error monitoring wiring (CF-89).

`init_sentry()` is called once per service process (api, worker). It is a
no-op when ``SENTRY_DSN`` is unset or the ``sentry-sdk`` package isn't
installed, so local and test runs need no Sentry account.

Every event and breadcrumb is scrubbed before it leaves the process: request
auth headers are dropped and any known secret string (Supabase service-role
key, Roboflow key, R2 keys, Modal tokens, JWT secret) is redacted wherever it
appears. ``send_default_pii=False`` and ``max_request_body_size="never"`` keep
user PII and request bodies out of events entirely.
