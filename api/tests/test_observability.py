"""Scrubbing tests for the Sentry wiring (CF-89 follow-up).

Covers the gap flagged as non-blocking on #107: the full connection URLs were
scrubbed, but the same password re-rendered in another form was not.

Imports only `app.observability`, which pulls in `app.config` — no database,
no network, no sentry-sdk required.
