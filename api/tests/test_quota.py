"""CF-91: upload limits and per-user quota.

Two halves, because the first one alone was not enough. `check_upload_allowed`
is a pure decision over a QuotaStatus, so the policy table is testable without
a database. But every hole found in review lived in the *enforcement* rather
than the policy — a quota that could be refunded by deleting the game, a check
that raced its own insert, an omitted form field that bought free minutes — and
none of those would have failed a policy test. The second half covers the
pieces that turn the decision into a control — the ledger the count is read
from, and the reservation that claims a slot.

The last link, that the upload handlers actually call any of this, is covered
in test_uploads.py alongside the presign flow's own fakes.
