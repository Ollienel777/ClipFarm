"""CF-172 — a production start must fail on missing config, not fall back to it.

The failure this guards against was silent by construction. Render's env group
only creates keys that carry a literal `value:`, so every `sync: false` key is
absent until a human pastes it in — and the api's `database_url` had a working
localhost default underneath, so an absent `DATABASE_URL` produced
`Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 5432)` from the pre-deploy migration rather
than anything naming the variable. The Supabase and R2 credentials are the same
shape and fail even later, at the first auth check or upload.

Two halves are tested here: the validator itself, and the two deployment files
that turn it on. The second half matters as much as the first — a guard the
production config never enables is not a guard.
