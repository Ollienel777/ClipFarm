"""CF-108: read authorization matrix.

The acceptance criterion is a table over {owner, follower, stranger, anonymous}
x {private, followers, public}, for games and clips, in both single-object and
list form. These are the security boundary — if one cell flips, someone's
footage becomes readable by someone it shouldn't be.

Pure logic: `services/access.py` imports only SQLAlchemy and the models, so no
database is needed. The list-filter cases compile the predicate and assert on
the SQL rather than executing it.
