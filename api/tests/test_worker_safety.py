"""CF-65a/CF-184: worker redelivery/concurrency safety — broker config + per-game lock.

The `importorskip` guard is now belt-and-braces: the api CI job installs
api/requirements-dev.txt, so these execute in CI as well as locally. Run from
the api/ dir: `cd api && pytest tests/test_worker_safety.py`.

The lock tests come in two layers. The fake-connection ones pin the behaviour
that is ours (what `acquire`/`release` do with the connection); the Postgres
ones pin the behaviour that is the *database's* — mutual exclusion, and a lock
dying with its connection, which is the whole point of CF-184 and cannot be
demonstrated against a double. Those find a local Postgres by themselves (the
compose `db` service is enough) or take LOCK_TEST_DATABASE_URL, which is what CI
sets for its throwaway server; they skip only when there is no database at all.

# is how a lost lock once got stamped `ready` over another worker's live run.
# The fix is one `except LockLost: raise` per such block. The behaviour is not
# unit-testable without a seam into `process_game_task`, but the routing is:
# resolve each checkpoint to the handler that catches it and require it to be a
# LockLost one. This flips the moment a guard is removed.
