"""
Keep-window derivation for dead-time removal.

Turns signals the pipeline already computes (ball contacts, pose rally
windows) into the list of time windows worth keeping in a condensed video.
Everything between the windows is dead time and gets cut.

Unlike contacts_to_rallies() this is coverage-preserving, not curating:
no MAX_CLIP_DURATION subdivision (a long rally stays one span) and a looser
contact minimum, because dropping a real rally from a condensed game video
is much worse than including a marginal one.

Pure functions, no models, no I/O — tunables arrive as kwargs from the task.

Two keep-window builders ship here (`condense_mode` picks between them):

  "rules"    active_windows_from_contacts + bridge_windows_by_motion (CF-46)
  "guarded"  active_windows_guarded (CF-187) — the default: contacts are
             speed-gated, sustained motion opens windows of its own, pads are
             tight, and a track too sparse to judge abstains instead of guessing

# nothing. Such a sample is kept as NaN rather than discarded: 32-63% of the
# samples above it (measured per fixture) fall inside labeled play, so dropping
# them throws away real rally evidence and, because the abstain guard counts
# samples, penalises exactly the fast well-tracked games it should trust. NaN
# keeps the sample's existence — which is what the density test reads — while
# refusing to believe its size. Matches ball.py's SEG_MAX_SPEED_PXPS
# (1200 px/s = 1.11 frame-heights/s at 1080p).
#
# It used to *clamp* to this ceiling, which had the opposite effect on the one
# block with no evidence gate in front of it. Every consumer reduces speed to a
# boolean far below the ceiling — the anchor's bar is 0.30 — so a clamped
# sample did not read as "unbelievably fast", it read as fast with 3.7x margin.
# A between-sets stretch where the tracker alternates between two stationary
# balls is nothing but over-ceiling samples, and it opened a full-width motion
# anchor over pure dead time. NaN votes for neither side, which is the honest
# answer for a displacement whose size we have just declared meaningless.
#
# That equivalence holds *at 1080p only*, and the "at 1080p" is not a footnote:
# in px/s this ceiling scales with the source, so on 360p footage it sits at
# 400 px/s — 3x stricter than the tracker's own cap. It bites accordingly:
# 226 of test1's 5636 usable samples (4.0%) exceed it against 2 under a literal
# px/s cap.
#
# That asymmetry used to cost nothing under the old clamp, and the evidence was
# a fixture re-run with this cap at the px/s equivalent and with it removed
# entirely: byte-identical windows and nets on all five. That measurement does
# NOT carry over to NaN, and it is worth being explicit about why — all three
# variants it compared leave a believable magnitude at or above the anchor's
# per-sample speed bar of 0.30, so all three vote "fast" and of course agree.
# (0.30 is the speed a sample must reach; ANCHOR_MIN_FRACTION, 0.40, is what
# share of a window must reach it. Different numbers, easy to conflate.) NaN is
# the first variant that votes *not fast*, which is the whole point of it, and
# therefore the first that measurement cannot speak for.
#
# What bounds it, from driving motion_anchor_windows directly: an anchor is lost
# only where believable-fast samples fall under ANCHOR_MIN_FRACTION — ~80% of a
# window over-ceiling if nothing else in it is slow, ~30% if half the window
# already sits below the bar (pinned in test_dead_time.py). Against test1's 4.0%
# global rate that is comfortable, and the fixture re-score at 42b582f bears out
# the direction without the collapse: coverage did go — every fixture now
# removes more dead time than under the clamp and cuts more live play with it,
# which is exactly what losing keep-windows looks like — but none fell off the

    Windows from sustained fast ball motion, independent of contacts.

    46 rallies produce no contact at all, the single largest source of removed
    live play. Rally flight is fast and sustained; between-rally handling is not.

    Unlike bridge_windows_by_motion this creates windows rather than joining
    them, so the evidence bar is higher: a full second must sit inside a

    samples, and the resulting run must last min_seconds.

    `track_is_usable` tests the whole-video sample rate, while `min_samples`
    here is a local bar. A game that is well tracked in one half and sparse in
    the other passes the guard and then anchors nothing across the sparse half,

    merge 3.0) whose safety argument is that the anchor gave every rally a

    rules-width pads over stretches with no usable local density — which also

    Keep-windows from speed-gated contacts plus motion anchors, or the whole

    Three changes from the rule-based path, each measured on the dead-time
    fixtures and none safe alone:

      - contacts fired over a near-stationary ball are rejected (speed_gate)
      - sustained motion opens its own windows, so a rally the contact detector
        misses is no longer cut outright (motion_anchor)
      - pads shrink to 3.0/2.0 with merge 3.0. pad_before + pad_after +
        merge_gap is the gap a real break must exceed to survive, and the median
        inter-rally gap is 13-14s against the rule-based path's 14s budget — so
        half of all true dead gaps were being erased by arithmetic before
        detection quality mattered. Only safe once the anchor has given every
        rally its own window.

    pad_before/pad_after apply to the contact-derived windows only; anchor
    windows carry their own `anchor_pad` and do **not** follow them. The two pad
    different things: a contact window is anchored at points and has to reach
    back over the untracked serve, while an anchor window already spans the
    motion it found, so the contact pads would double-count it. Raising
    pad_before therefore has no effect on a rally recovered purely by the anchor.

    Abstaining returns a single whole-video window: on a track that thin every
    builder buys dead time by cutting play, so declining to condense is both the
    better score and the honest answer. The caller sees a normal window list and
    ships an uncondensed video.

    `min_track_rate` says *that* an abstain region exists; it does not say where
    its edge belongs. In usable samples/s the fixtures sit at 0.57 (the game that
    must abstain) and 1.51-2.99 (the four that must not), so the default 1.0
    stands in a wide clean gap with nothing observed inside it. Treat the boundary
    as unconstrained rather than tuned — and note the evidence is one game, which
    is also the game excluded from cross-game comparison (see
    EXCLUDED_FROM_TOTALS in ml/eval/visualize_deadtime.py). On the comparable
    fixtures the abstain never fires, so v4 and v5 score identically there: this
    switch is supported by a single excluded fixture, and a per-region degrade
    would be a better shape than an all-or-nothing flip.

    Raises on a missing frame height rather than abstaining on one: every speed
    here is normalized by it, so a zero would silently turn every game into an
    abstain. The condense stage catches and falls back to the rule-based windows,
