"""
Keep-window derivation for dead-time removal.

Turns signals the pipeline already computes (ball contacts, pose rally
windows) into the list of time windows worth keeping in a condensed video.
Everything between the windows is dead time and gets cut.

Unlike contacts_to_rallies() this is coverage-preserving, not curating:
no MAX_CLIP_DURATION subdivision (a long rally stays one span) and a looser
contact minimum, because dropping a real rally from a condensed game video
is much worse than including a marginal one.

Pure functions, no models, no I/O — tunables arrive as kwargs from the task.

    Merge adjacent windows when the tracked ball keeps moving fast through
    the gap between them (CF-46: fixes mid-rally cuts).

    Contact detection goes silent for long stretches of real play (far-court
    possessions, occlusions, smooth trajectories), splitting one rally into
    two windows. The ball track itself usually survives those stretches, and
    in-play flight is fast while between-rally handling (carrying, tossing a
    ball back) is mostly slow. So: bridge a gap only when at least
    fast_fraction of the speed samples inside it exceed speed_pxps.

    Guards against re-admitting dead time:
      - gaps longer than max_bridge_seconds never bridge (a between-games
        break with a few fast shag throws stays cut)
      - fewer than min_samples speed samples is no evidence — no bridge
      - presence alone never *creates* a window; this only joins windows
        already anchored by contacts

    positions are dicts with "time", "x", "y" (ball-track samples). Speeds
    are taken between consecutive samples closer than max_sample_spacing,
    so a tracking dropout contributes no samples rather than a huge jump.
