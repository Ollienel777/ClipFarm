# ffmpeg sizes its thread pools from the visible core count, which inside a
# container is the HOST's, not what the cgroup allows. On a 16-core host x264
# defaults to ~24 encoder threads and allocates per-thread frame buffers —
# hundreds of MB at 1080p — which OOM-killed the 512 MB worker on its first
# production run (CF-224). Every encode and decode below pins the count.
#
# Callers pass the deployed value (api Settings.ffmpeg_threads), since the right
# number depends on the instance plan. Production runs 1 on a whole CPU
# (`standard`, CF-240) — that 1 was measured at 0.5 CPU under CF-224 and carried
# over unchanged when the plan grew, so it is a known-safe value rather than a
# tuned one; CF-223 re-measures it at the new size. This is the fallback for a
# bare pipeline call: low enough for any container, since the whole failure mode
# is a default sized by the wrong machine.
