"""
Audio energy analysis for detection confidence weighting.

Extracts the audio track from a video, computes RMS energy over time,
and uses it to boost detections near loud moments (cheering, ball hits,
whistles) and penalize detections during silence (dead time).

No extra dependencies — uses FFmpeg (subprocess) + numpy.
