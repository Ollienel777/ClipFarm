"""
Modal GPU deployment for ball tracking (CF-11).

Ball tracking is the pipeline's dominant cost: ~27-42 min on CPU per game
(frame-by-frame RF-DETR inference). This module deploys the exact same
`track_ball()` used locally onto a T4 GPU, where the same workload runs in
low single-digit minutes.

Deploy:
    modal deploy ml/modal_app.py

Requires a Modal account + CLI auth (`modal setup`) and MODAL_TOKEN_ID /
MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET set wherever this is deployed from or invoked. The
Roboflow API key is passed as a plain argument (not a Modal Secret) to keep
initial setup simple — same key already lives in worker env as
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY. Tightening this to a proper Modal Secret is a follow-up,
not a blocker.
