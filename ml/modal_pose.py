"""
Modal GPU deployment for pose classification (CF-164).

Second half of the GPU offload that started with ball tracking (CF-11). Pose
was the last model still running in the worker image, and it is the reason
that image carries torch + ultralytics — which at the time was why the Render
worker sat on `standard` (2 GB). Moving pose here lets the worker image drop
to ffmpeg + opencv + numpy + boto3, and lets the *full-quality* pose config
(yolov8s-pose @ 1280) come back: it was downgraded to yolov8n @ 640 in
`render.yaml` only because a 2 GB CPU box could not carry the real one.

(The worker is on `standard` again as of CF-240, but for libx264's ~400 MB
during cutting, not for an import — nothing here ships a model any more.)

Both functions call the same `ml.pipeline.detect` code the worker calls
locally, so this is an execution-location change, not a second implementation.
(The old `ml/modal_detect.py` was a second implementation — a drifted copy of
`classify_action` wired to nothing — and is deleted by this change.)

Video arrives by presigned R2 URL, same as `modal_app.py`: R2 credentials stay
in the worker and never need to exist as a Modal Secret. Refinement reads that
URL in place rather than downloading it first — see `classify_windows_remote`.

Deploy:
    modal deploy ml/modal_pose.py

Requires a Modal account + CLI auth (`modal setup`) and MODAL_TOKEN_ID /
MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET wherever this is invoked from.

    seeks per window, so nothing above this call changes.
