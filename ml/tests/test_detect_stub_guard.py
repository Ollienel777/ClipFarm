"""CF-164: `run_detection` must not fabricate clips unless asked to.

`_stub_detections` invents clips at invented timestamps with a flat 0.75
confidence. That is a development affordance, but the worker persists whatever
`run_detection` returns, and since CF-164 the deployed image has no pose runtime
— so the stub sat one Modal failure away from being written to the database as
genuine highlights.

Stdlib-only, like the rest of ml/tests: cv2 and numpy are stubbed so the module
imports without them (the CI job installs neither). Nothing here touches either
stub — the guard fires on the *ultralytics* import, well before any frame work.
