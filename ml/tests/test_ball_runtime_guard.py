"""CF-225: the local ball path must say what is actually missing.

Ball tracking runs on Modal (CF-11) and the deployed image has carried no
Roboflow `inference` runtime since CF-164 — so the local-CPU fallback in
`_track_ball_cached` cannot run there at all. Left as a bare `from inference
import get_model`, a Modal outage surfaced as `ModuleNotFoundError: inference`,
which reads as a packaging bug and buries the outage that caused it.

Stdlib-only, like the rest of ml/tests: cv2 and numpy are stubbed so the module
imports without them. The guard fires on the `inference` import, before any
frame work touches either.
