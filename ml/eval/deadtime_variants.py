"""
Candidate keep-window builders for the dead-time condense stage (CF-173 follow-up).

The two endpoints of this ladder ship: `v0` is `condense_mode="rules"` and `v5` is
`condense_mode="guarded"`, the default since CF-187. Both call
`ml/pipeline/dead_time.py` rather than reimplementing it — a variant that scores
well here and drifts from what production runs would be worse than no comparison
at all. `v1`-`v4` stay prototypes: each is one step of the ladder, kept so the
next change can be judged against the rungs rather than only against the ends.

Each builder takes a Game and returns keep-windows, so they are directly
comparable. The diagnosis they respond to (measured on test2 + test4):

  - the motion bridge is net-negative on both games
  - 24% (test2) / 48% (test4) of contacts fire during dead time, and killing
    those is worth more than every parameter change combined
  - 19 of test4's 46 rallies produce no contact at all, and contacts are the
    only thing that can open a window — so that play is cut outright
