"""
Detection-recall diagnostic (CF-98 follow-up).

The CF-98 baseline showed the condense stage deleting 41.6% of real play, and
traced the cause upstream: 214 ball contacts over 126 labeled rallies, so whole
rallies are never detected. This tool answers the next question — *which half*
of the detection chain loses them:

    video → ball model (sampled frames) → positions → find_contacts() → contacts

For every labeled rally it counts the ball positions and the contacts falling
inside, which separates two failures with completely different fixes:

  BLIND    positions == 0  — the model never saw the ball here. Fixing this
                             means sample rate, model, or weights.
  REJECTED positions >= 1 but contacts == 0 — the ball *was* tracked, and
                             find_contacts() declined to call any of it a hit.
                             Fixing this is threshold work, no re-tracking.

It also dumps the raw positions and contacts to JSON so the rejection case can
be iterated on locally at zero cost (no container, no video download), the same
way --dump-windows lets the harness re-score offline runs.

Run it where the worker deps live:

  docker compose run --rm --no-deps worker \
    python -m ml.eval.diagnose_detection --test test1
